  Hello! I'm Ziqi, currently a software engineer at Microsoft, working on machine learning models in production. I am passionate about innovations that enable machine learning to empower successful and reliable applications, which requires robustness (in a changing environment), fairness, and efficiency. I am particularly interested in fundamental solutions to these issues, involving representation and interaction. Previously, I studied computer science and statistics at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), where I (graduated early to) work on [formulating quantum sensing as a learning problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08702), advised by [Prof. Fred Chong](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/); and applied machine learning to [ioT-based water quality prediction](https://thoreau.uchicago.edu), advised by [Prof. Supratik Guha](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/supratik-guha) and [Prof. Monisha Ghosh](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/monisha-ghosh).

          2021.8.24 - I got to write about one of my favorite topics-"how/when research becomes useful in practice", based on interviews with ML practitioners and organization leaders at Microsoft! It's published on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Navigating the (long and winding) road from innovation to production](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/navigating-the-long-and-winding-road-from-innovation-to-production-b9ab14ec065d)<br>
          2021.6.8 - Check out this article I wrote with my co-authors on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Data science perspectives on averages and related areas](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/data-science-perspectives-on-averages-and-related-areas-4df73468f820)<br>
          2021.6.2 - The fair ML compression project I initiated got featured by PureAI: [Researchers Explore Intelligent Sampling of Huge ML Datasets to Reduce Costs and Maintain Model Fairness](https://pureai.com/articles/2021/05/03/intelligent-ai-sampling.aspx) <br>
          2020.10.15 - Presented work on circuit learning for quantum sensing at IEEE QCE20 Practical Quantum Sensing Workshop

          I initiated a collaboration with Microsoft Research on coreset compression to speed up ML training (MSR AI School invited project, 8% acceptance rate), but during implementation realized existing techniques do not consider fairness, which motivated this research as side project.<br>

          I graduated early to lead this collaboration project between members of CS and Molecular Engineering Departments - formulated sensing protocol design as a learning problem by constructing parametrized encoder/decoder circuits; enabled on-device learning from limited, noisy measurements via robust gradient estimation

          This is an ioT project for environment monitoring, including a soil sensor network deployed in UChicago campus and a water-body sensing system deployed in India. I used machine learning (tree-based models, neural networks, active learning) for water quality (BOD, COD) prediction, and set up the LoRa system (embedded, wireless, backend) for soil sensing.
