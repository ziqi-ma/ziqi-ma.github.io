  Hello! I am Ziqi, a first-year PhD student at [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu) working on visual reasoning in 3D. I am advised by [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php). Prior to grad school, I was a software engineer at Microsoft AI Platform. Before that I was an undergrad at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) double-majoring in CS and statistics.

          2023.9.14 - Moved to Pasadena to start my PhD at Caltech as a Kortschak Scholar!<br>
          2023.9.5 - Check out this new article I wrote on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Many facets of un-truth: LLM hallucination 101](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/many-facets-of-un-truth-llm-hallucination-101-8273806fa145). This is a 101 on hallucination that I wish I had when getting started with LLMs. Hope it could be helpful to you too!<br>
          2023.4.25 - Check out this new article I wrote on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Reasoning about change: Lessons learned from building a near real-time system for Azure pricing](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/reasoning-about-change-lessons-learned-from-building-a-near-real-time-system-for-azure-pricing-34049816ffbd1). The pricing projects led me to read up on the development of various industrial streaming systems in the past decade. Such a journey from POC to industry standard - quite inspiring!<br>
          2023.3.7 - Check out this new article I wrote on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Speeding up "Reverse ETL"](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/speeding-up-reverse-etl-3af04e069fd1).<br>
          2021.12.21 - Check out this new article I wrote on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [What do we talk about when we talk about ML robustness](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/what-do-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-ml-robustness-4e58a55f9b8f). Distribution shift is only part of the story!<br>
          2021.8.24 - I got to write about one of my favorite topics - "how/when research becomes useful in practice", based on interviews with ML practitioners and organization leaders at Microsoft! It's published on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Navigating the (long and winding) road from innovation to production](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/navigating-the-long-and-winding-road-from-innovation-to-production-b9ab14ec065d)<br>
          2021.6.8 - Check out this article I wrote with my co-authors on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Data science perspectives on averages and related areas](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/data-science-perspectives-on-averages-and-related-areas-4df73468f820)<br>
          2021.6.2 - The fair ML compression project I initiated got featured by PureAI: [Researchers Explore Intelligent Sampling of Huge ML Datasets to Reduce Costs and Maintain Model Fairness](https://pureai.com/articles/2021/05/03/intelligent-ai-sampling.aspx) <br>
          2020.10.15 - Presented work on circuit learning for quantum sensing at IEEE QCE20 Practical Quantum Sensing Workshop

          I initiated a collaboration with Microsoft Research on coreset compression to speed up ML training (MSR AI School invited project, 8% acceptance rate), but during implementation realized existing techniques do not consider fairness, which motivated this research as side project.<br>

          I graduated early to lead this collaboration project between members of CS and Molecular Engineering Departments - formulated sensing protocol design as a learning problem by constructing parametrized encoder/decoder circuits; enabled on-device learning from limited, noisy measurements via robust gradient estimation

          This is an ioT project for environment monitoring, including a soil sensor network deployed in UChicago campus and a water-body sensing system deployed in India. I used machine learning (tree-based models, neural networks, active learning) for water quality (BOD, COD) prediction, and set up the LoRa system (embedded, wireless, backend) for soil sensing.
