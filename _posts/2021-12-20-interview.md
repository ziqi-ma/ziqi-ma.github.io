I got to write about one of my favorite topics - "how/when research becomes useful in practice", based on interviews with ML practitioners and organization leaders at Microsoft! It's published on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Navigating the (long and winding) road from innovation to production](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/navigating-the-long-and-winding-road-from-innovation-to-production-b9ab14ec065d)<br>
