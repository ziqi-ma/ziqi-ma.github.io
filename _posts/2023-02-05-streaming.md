Check out this new article I wrote on Data Science@Microsoft medium blog: [Reasoning about change: Lessons learned from building a near real-time system for Azure pricing](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/reasoning-about-change-lessons-learned-from-building-a-near-real-time-system-for-azure-pricing-34049816ffbd1). The pricing projects led me to read up on the development of various industrial streaming systems in the past decade. Such a journey from POC to industry standard - quite inspiring!
