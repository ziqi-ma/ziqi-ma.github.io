Adaptive Circuit Learning for Quantum Metrology is published at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08702)).
I graduated early from UChicago to lead this collaboration project between members of CS and Molecular Engineering Departments - formulated sensing protocol design as a learning problem by constructing parametrized encoder/decoder circuits; enabled on-device learning from limited, noisy measurements via robust gradient estimation.
