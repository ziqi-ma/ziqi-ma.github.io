I initiated and drove a collaboration with MSR while working in product. This project was featured by PureAI [link](https://pureai.com/articles/2021/05/03/intelligent-ai-sampling.aspx). We devloped loss-based sampling method to make training more efficient and fair. This algorithm was deployed in production.
