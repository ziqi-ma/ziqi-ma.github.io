Hello! I am Ziqi, a PhD student at [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu). I work on 3D computer vision, with the ultimate goal of enabling AI in the physical world. I am advised by [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I recently interned at [Meta SuperIntelligence Labs](https://ai.meta.com/research/) with [Sasha Sax](https://alexsax.github.io/). Prior to grad school, I was at Microsoft and The University of Chicago. I am supported by the [Kortschak Scholarship](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars).
