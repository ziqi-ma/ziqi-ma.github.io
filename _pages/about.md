Hello! I am Ziqi, a PhD student at [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu). I work on 3D computer vision, with the ultimate goal of enabling embodied AI applications. I am advised by [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). Prior to grad school, I worked as a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) AI Platform. I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Statistics at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). I am supported by the [Kortschak Scholarship](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars).
